I managed to update the blog so that I can use NetlifyCMS.  Hooray.  The 'collections' portion of the tutorial and configuring of the `config.yml` was really confusing.  In the end, I just copied and pasted the provided one in the tutorial after I tried to log-in and the identity page gave me an error message that said I was missing a required field 'name' in 'collections\[0].field\[0]'. 

I'm writing this document from the web admin GUI.  Hopefully the post goes here.

I still have to 'kick the tires' to see if I worked out all the bugs in setting up the CMS.
