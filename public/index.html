  Summary Installing Docker on a non-LTS version can result in there not being a tested version for your OS. So either always get an LTS version or check to see if a supported version exists for your OS version.
The Story So, I downloaded Ubuntu 19.10, the non-LTS version unlike 19.04 (Disco), which is named &lsquo;Eoan&rsquo; which one can figure out using the following:
$ lsb_release -cs ### eoan  Initial thoughts are that the resulting output is an error; however, if one goes to the following wikipedia article here, Ubuntu 19.

  I tried using the new-ish MongoDB Golang Controller/Driver.
An issue I had with using it was that the MongoDB Deployment I was using didn&rsquo;t support retryable writes and the error message stated that it wanted me to add retryWrites=false to my connection string. The thing is the tutorial/blog post I was following here didn&rsquo;t mention anything regarding that.
The error message was as follows:
$ 2019/09/08 23:21:04 this MongoDB deployment does not support retryable writes.

  Some notes from Make Your Own Pixel Art using Aseprite from the first 17 pages.
Apparently the &lsquo;.png&rsquo; format is the most flexible for pixel artists.
 E: Is the short cut for Eraser B: Is the shortcut for the pencil H: Is the Hand Tool shortcut I: Is the Eyedropper tool G: Is the Paint Bucket shortcut L: Is the Short Cut for Straight Lines
 `, 1-6 are various degrees of zoom.

  There isn&rsquo;t that much in terms of direction for installing stuff on WSL which is linux-y with Microsoft Windows quirks. Hopefully this post makes it such that there is slightly more direction on the matter. I read through this post and felt that it was quite helpful. I also tried the linux steps from the golang.org site (link).
Note, despite having a Windows Host, I am running WSL and downloading the Linux version of Golang.

  I managed to update the blog so that I can use NetlifyCMS. Hooray. The &lsquo;collections&rsquo; portion of the tutorial and configuring of the config.yml was really confusing. In the end, I just copied and pasted the provided one in the tutorial after I tried to log-in and the identity page gave me an error message that said I was missing a required field &lsquo;name&rsquo; in &lsquo;collections[0].field[0]&lsquo;.
I&rsquo;m writing this document from the web admin GUI.

  I mentioned in my previous post that I still had to &lsquo;kick the tires&rsquo;.
Here&rsquo;s some stuff that worked out. I can login and logout successfully. The changes made on the web GUI are committed to the Github repository. Thus, I could successfully pull the updates via CLI:
 $ git pull origin master
 Things that aren&rsquo;t working out or are weird &lsquo;quirks&rsquo;. 1. Each post I create requires a &lsquo;Featured Image&rsquo; be selected in the &lsquo;Admin&rsquo; interface despite the aforementioned images being not-visible in blog.

  Aside: So, my [BuildScript](&ldquo;https://royu.netlify.com/posts/buildscript/&quot;) has already come in handy. I forgot how to make a new post in hugo. The line that came in handy was as follows:
&gt; $ hugo new posts/name-of-my-new-post.md &gt; ``` This may or may not be a growing list. I, as with many things, have not decided yet. Some things I've learned from using netlify functions: &gt; You have to remember to disconnect from your data store otherwise your function hands for 10 seconds and then times out.

  So, I finally started using WSL or Windows Subsystem for Linux. The reason being that I tried to get nvm for windows to work out by deleting my original installs of Node and then setting up nvm for windows but I think I missed a spot and couldn&rsquo;t find out which spot I missed. As a result, I am unsure of the version of Node that my path refers to.

  So, I&rsquo;ve the Hugo quickstart a few times. The thing is, I do it once and then leave it alone. I feel bad for leaving the blog folder all alone and finally get the courage to try again. Unforunately, at this I&rsquo;ve forgotten all the commands, syntax and what they all do, hence why I&rsquo;ve done it &lsquo;a few times&rsquo;. This post is an attempt to change that. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll pan out.

   The first post on the blog. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do this for a while but things get lost in the shuffle. I think there will no posts of any consequence written here. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll be proven correct.
